"""REFERENCE ONLY - not part of the build, and it will not run as it stands.

This is the English bocage layout the map used to carry. It is kept because it is
the only copy: nothing here is in git history. It is superseded by `generate_osm.py`,
which writes the extent and nothing else.

Two things before running it: it needs `map_source.py` (missing from the tree), and
it writes to `map.osm`, so it would overwrite the clean file.

FS25 OSM generator - English bocage countryside.

Writes `map.osm` for the playable 8192 x 8192 m area, laid out from the two images in
`inspiracion/` (read through `map_source.py`, shared with the DEM generator):

  * woodland, buildings and hedgerow density come from `mapa_visual.jpeg`;
  * the river alignment comes from the dark channel in `mapa_alturas.jpeg`.

The field pattern is not traced pixel-by-pixel - the hedges in the source photo are not a
closed partition, so tracing them merges whole districts into single 100 ha blobs.
Instead the *distribution* is followed: the local hedgerow density sets a target field
size, Poisson-disk seeds are drawn at that spacing, and their Voronoi cells become the
parcels. Dense hedges near the village give small fields, the open uplands give large
ones, which is what the source actually shows.

The lanes are chosen from the Voronoi edges themselves - a shortest-path tree over the
cell boundaries linking the village, the settlements and the map edges - so they run
along field boundaries and wander the way English lanes do, rather than on a grid.

Settlements: the one nearest the centre of the map is the village, emitted as a single
`landuse=farmyard` with its streets on top. Every other settlement becomes one flat
`landuse=farmyard` pad for a production to be placed on, per the map brief.

The lanes know nothing about the village, so they are trimmed at its boundary and the
streets inside are laid out from the entrances that leaves: a high street between the
two most opposite ones, a side street per remaining entrance, and a back lane closing a
block either side. Without that the village is simply the two networks overlaid.

Tag vocabulary is unchanged from the previous map, so the rest of the pipeline
(visualizer, Giants Editor import) keeps working:
    landuse=farmland                              fields
    landuse=farmyard                              village, industry pads, yards
    natural=wood + landuse=farmyard + leaf_type   woodland
    natural=water                                 the river
    highway=primary / secondary / tertiary        road hierarchy
